The trajectory details a comprehensive development cycle for a Jira-like application, managed by a previous AI engineer. The work began with fixing a critical bug in the assignee selection feature within the React frontend, which involved diagnosing and correcting a UI component error ( with an empty value) and implementing missing event handler logic in .

Following this fix, the engineer implemented a series of new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features, introducing Lead/Head and Admin Plus roles with specific visibility rules, a new Payments board, and a dedicated API endpoint for fetching context-aware assignable users. Subsequently, the user requested the removal of the Admin Plus role and Payments board, which the engineer executed precisely by reverting the relevant backend and frontend code.

The most significant phase was a complete overhaul of the application's architecture based on a four-block requirement list.
- **Block A:** A new, sophisticated Access Control List (ACL) backend was built with , , and complex  models.
- **Block B:** A full-featured Admin Settings UI was created for managing these new entities.
- **Block C:** An Expenses Dashboard with departmental data aggregation and charts was implemented.
- **Block D:** A responsive navigation system with a resizable desktop sidebar and a mobile bottom navigation bar was developed.

This large-scale refactoring introduced several bugs, which were systematically debugged, including fixing React rendering errors caused by new data structures, resolving library dependency issues (), and correcting a critical task creation failure. The final actions involved re-implementing a user management CRUD interface that was lost during the refactor, bringing the project to a stable, feature-rich state.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build and enhance a sophisticated Jira-like project management application with a multi-tiered, department-based access control system.

**Core Functionality:**
- User authentication and management.
- Creation and management of Kanban boards with columns and draggable tasks.
- Task attributes: title, description, priority, assignee, due date, tags, amount, category.

**Implemented Advanced Features:**
1.  **Complex ACL System (Block A):**
    -   **Departments:** The organization is structured into departments (e.g., Gambling, Sweeps, Office, Tech).
    -   **Roles & Groups:** Users are assigned roles within departments (e.g., Head, Lead, Buyer) and can be grouped into teams led by a Lead.
    -   **Granular Visibility:** Board access is controlled by either user groups or individual users. Content within boards can be filtered by department.
    -   **Specific Role Rules:**
        -   C-Level (CEO, COO, CTO) have global access.
        -   Department Heads see all tasks within their department.
        -   Leads see tasks of their specific group.
        -   Buyers/Designers see tech/designer boards for their department and only their own tasks otherwise.
        -   Office Managers are restricted to their department's expenses.
2.  **Admin UI (Block B):** A dedicated settings panel for C-level users to perform CRUD operations on Departments, Groups, and Users, and to configure board visibility.
3.  **Expenses Dashboard (Block C):** A data visualization dashboard aggregating expenses across the organization, with charts and tables, filterable by date and department (for authorized roles).
4.  **Responsive Layout (Block D):** The UI adapts to different screen sizes, featuring a resizable sidebar on desktop and a bottom tab bar on mobile/tablet devices.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Monorepo**: Next.js (React) frontend and FastAPI (Python) backend.
- **Database**: MongoDB for all data persistence.
- **ACL/RBAC**: A highly granular, department-and-group-based Access Control List system enforced on the backend.
- **API**: RESTful API with JWT-based authentication.
- **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS for styling, with a unified dark theme. UI components are from  and .
- **Data Visualization**:  library for rendering charts on the Expenses Dashboard.
- **Process Management**:  for running and managing the backend and frontend services.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo located in , with the backend in  and the frontend in .



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the application's core. It defines all data models (Pydantic), API endpoints, authentication logic, and crucially, the entire complex server-side ACL enforcement.
    -   **Changes**: Massively refactored to support the new ACL system. New models like , , and  were added. , , and  models were updated. New CRUD endpoints for  and a new  endpoint were created. The logic for fetching and filtering tasks/boards was completely rewritten to respect the new visibility rules.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Essential for setting up the application with valid data that reflects the new, complex ACL structure.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to replace the old seed script. It populates the database with Departments, Roles, Groups, Users with specific roles/departments, and Boards with the new visibility configurations.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the UI for the entire Block B requirement, allowing administrators to manage the new ACL system.
    -   **Changes**: Created as a multi-tabbed modal component for full CRUD operations on Users, Departments, and Groups, including forms for creating/editing users with role and department assignments.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, handling routing and global layout.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly modified to implement the responsive layout (Block D). It now uses the  hook to conditionally render either the  for desktop or the  for smaller screens, wrapping the main content area. New routes for  were also added.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Fulfills the Block C requirement, providing key business intelligence.
    -   **Changes**: Overhauled to fetch and display aggregated expense data. Integrated the  library to render pie and bar charts, and added UI elements for filtering data by date and department.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core user-facing feature for task management.
    -   **Changes**: Initially modified to fix the assignee selection bug. The logic for fetching assignable users was updated to call the new context-aware backend endpoint.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. The AI engineer successfully completed all four requested blocks (A, B, C, D) and fixed all subsequently reported bugs, including critical issues with task creation and UI rendering. The last action was to restore the user management functionality, which was completed successfully.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work involved a critical bug-fixing and feature-restoration phase following the massive ACL and UI overhaul (Blocks A-D).

The user reported that task creation was failing (Faiiled to create task: Unknown error) and that the user management UI had disappeared from the admin settings.

1.  **Fixing Task Creation**: The AI engineer correctly hypothesized a backend issue. The  agent was invoked, which diagnosed that the  model was missing the newly required  field. The agent patched the  endpoint in  to correctly derive and include this ID, resolving the bug.

2.  **Restoring User Management**: The engineer then focused on the frontend.
    -   A new Users tab was added to the  component.
    -   Backend CRUD endpoints (, ,  for ) were implemented in .
    -   The  component was updated with state management () and handler functions (, , ) to provide full user management functionality, including a form for creating/editing users with name, email, password, role selection, and department assignment.

This work was successfully completed and tested, bringing the application to a stable state with all requested features implemented and major bugs resolved.

<optional_next_step>
Await user feedback and validation of the implemented Blocks A, B, C, D, and the recent bug fixes before proceeding with any new tasks.
